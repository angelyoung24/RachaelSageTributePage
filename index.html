            <p>
                Since founding her own label MPress Records two decades ago, NYC-based alt-pop artist Rachael Sage has
                steadily released a slew of vibrant, dynamic albums with poetic lyrics spanning subjects as wide as her
                inspirations. She has toured with an eclectic
                list of artists including Ani DiFranco, Beth Hart, Sarah McLachlan, Judy Collins and Howard Jones. Sage
                also continues to significantly grow her visibility via her many song placements, having recently
                landed her 22nd song on top reality show
                Dance Moms, translating into over 10 million YouTube hits. Her upcoming album Myopia (due May 4) is a
                bold departure for Sage, with a much stronger emphasis on her guitar playing over her signature piano
                palette. Produced by Sage and her longtime
                engineer, 2-time Grammy® Nominee John Shyloski, the album features drummer Doug Yowell (Joe Jackson,
                Duncan Sheik), keyboardist Rob Curto (Lila Downes), trumpeter Russ Johnson (Elvis Costello, Deborah
                Harry) and bassist Mike Visceglia (Suzanne
                Vega). Sage will headline a series of national shows in support of Myopia following an opening slot for
                Howard Jones’ U.S. tour and continuing with a full schedule of performances throughout the year.</p>
